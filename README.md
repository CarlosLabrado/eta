# ETA (in progress)

### The problem
Most of the time in our lives we make plans to meet people on places. It can be going to the movies, to the bar, etc. To achieve this we pick a **place** and a **time**, but more often that not, for many reasons, we might not be able to get there on time and is likely that a person will have to wait for the other to arrive.

Now the person that got there **on time** or **earlier** would like to know when the other person is arriving, So.

### The solution
The purpose of this app is to make for a **simple** and quick way to communicate when you are arriving at the place you planned with people that you are meeting. Because if we are going like 10 minutes late, we don't want to go and type: _"Hey I am going to be 10 minutes late"_ , and is not only because is a hassle, and **you are already late!**, and what if after those 10 minutes you really need another 5 minutes, **you don't want to write that!**

So for this app we make it real easy to communicate in no time.
